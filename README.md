# Confessional

A bot that lets you confess your sins (and anything else you want to say) to a specific server using a randomly generated or set code.

## Commands

* `x.createchannel <code>`
    * Creates a confession channel for you to use on your server. If you run x.createchannel without setting a code, a random code will be created for you.
* `x.banuser code`
    * Bans a user from sending in any confessions. Users cannot be unbanned with a code, so make sure you know what you're doing when you run this.
* `x.unbanuser @User`
    * Unbans a user from sending in confessions.
* `x.invite`
    * Want the bot on another server? This will give you the invite link!
* `x.support`
    * Got an issue with the bot? Head on over to my support server! A moderator will help you asap!

## How to Use
1. Invite the bot to your server
2. Run `x.createchannel` to make your confession channel
3. DM the bot your confession.
4. DM the bot the code of the server's confession channel
